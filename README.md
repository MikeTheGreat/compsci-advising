## Computing Majors & Specializations
What different majors are there?

* ACM's Computing Disciplines and Majors
  - [Computer Science](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=8): Currently the most popular of the computing disciplines; tends to be relatively broad and with an emphasis on the underlying science aspects.
  - [Computer Engineering](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=11): Typically involves software and hardware and the development of systems that involve software, hardware, and communications.
  - [Information Systems](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=9): Essentially, this is computing in an organizational context, typically in businesses.
  - [Information Technology](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=7): Focuses on computing infrastructure and needs of individual users; tends to involve a study of systems (perhaps just software systems, but perhaps also systems in support of learning, of information dissemination, etc.).
  - [Software Engineering](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12): Focuses on large-scale software systems; employs certain ideas from the world of engineering in building reliable software systems.
  - [Mixed Disciplinary Majors](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=10): Because computing is such an important and dynamic field, many interdisciplinary majors, some very recent developments, exist at some schools.
